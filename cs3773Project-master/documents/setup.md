So let's get going...

## Documents

Let's put all of our design docs in the "documents" directory in GitHub. I think this should work sufficiently well for that. **Please be mindful that issues that might arise from editing at the same time as someone else.** I don't have that much experience trying to edit the same piece of a project as other people in Git. And I'm not sure how this Visual Paradigm files will work with Git. I looked at one in Vim, they're part readable code, part binary garbage. We'll find out.

## Scrum Taskboard via ZenHub

This ZenHub Chrome plugin modifies the GitHub pages. It gives us a cool Scrum Taskboard as well as some other features. Read about and install it [here](zenhub.io).

## Visual Paradigm Community Edition

For our UML diagrams, let's use the community edition of Visual Paradigm, unless anyone has any objections? It seems the nicest of the ones I've perused. [Download it here.](http://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp)

## Android Studio & Java

~~There's no code due in the deliverables for March 31 so let's leave this setup for later.~~ JK we will need to have gone through sprints with 2 of our stories. Have Android Studio and Java SDK 7 setup on your system. We'll get an app project into the repo later once the design docs are underway.
