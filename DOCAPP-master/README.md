DOCAPP
======

This Android app was built during AngelHack Dubai.

The main aim of the app was to make it easier to connect Patients and Doctors.

Goals of the app are:

1) Searching doctors using any one or a combination of the following parameters:- Disease/Condition,Specialty, Location, Insurance company

2) Enable patients to book appointments with doctors

3) Doctor can write prescriptions directly through the app

4) Patients can view prescriptions 

5) Doctors have a view called "Today's Schedule" through which they can view their appointments for that day and manage patients

6) Similarly Patients too have a view called "My Appointments" where they can view all the appointments which they have booked.

(All the above features have been implemented)

Some additional feature I have thought of:

7) Add a doctor rating system. Not something like out of 5 stars. Instead patients can "Like" a doctor. So it'll be number of likes.

8) Allow the patient to see his/her medical history with the doctor. Test reports, vaccines taken, diagnosis, etc will be part of the history.
